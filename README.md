God, I need to stretch. And sugar haze from the soda, a beast of its own, too much sugar like a flash flood invading my veins. Ah, damn — someone told me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  . Is this how simulcasted nausea feels?

Now if(document.id == 'confused'){console.log('Mind blown into the stratosphere');}// What the actual weathered hell was that last bit?
